# Linux Basics Assignment Commands with Explanations

# 1. Creating and Renaming Files/Directories
mkdir test_dir        # Creates a directory named 'test_dir'
cd test_dir           # Moves inside the directory
touch example.txt     # Creates an empty file named 'example.txt'
mv example.txt renamed_example.txt   # Renames 'example.txt' to 'renamed_example.txt'
ls                    # Lists contents of the directory
cd ..                 # Moves back to the previous directory

# 2. Viewing File Contents
cat /etc/passwd       # Displays the entire content of the file
head -n 5 /etc/passwd # Shows the first 5 lines
tail -n 5 /etc/passwd # Shows the last 5 lines

# 3. Searching for Patterns
grep "root" /etc/passwd   # Searches for 'root' in the file and prints matching lines

# 4. Zipping and Unzipping
zip -r test_dir.zip test_dir        # Compresses 'test_dir' into test_dir.zip
unzip test_dir.zip -d unzipped_dir  # Extracts contents of test_dir.zip into 'unzipped_dir'

# 5. Downloading Files
wget https://example.com/sample.txt  # Downloads sample.txt from the given URL

# 6. Changing Permissions
touch secure.txt     # Creates an empty file
chmod 444 secure.txt # Changes file permissions to read-only for everyone
ls -l secure.txt     # Displays file details including permissions

# 7. Working with Environment Variables
export MY_VAR="Hello, Linux!"  # Creates an environment variable
echo $MY_VAR                   # Prints the value of MY_VAR
